            <h2>Understanding the 20/4/10 Rule</h2>
            <p>The 20/4/10 rule helps determine if a car loan is affordable by answering these three questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>→ 20: Can you make a down payment of at least 20% of the car's price?</li>
                <li>→ 4: Can you repay the loan within four years?</li>
                <li>→ 10: Will your total car-related expenses, including the loan, be 10% or less of your monthly income?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Practical Implementation</h3>
            <p>Consider you're planning to buy a vehicle. First, calculate 20% of the car's price to ensure you can afford the down payment. Next, choose a loan term of four years or less. Finally, tally up your estimated monthly car expenses, including the loan payment, insurance, fuel, maintenance, and other related costs. Make sure these expenses do not exceed 10% of your monthly income.</p>
            <p>For instance, if you decide to purchase a car that costs $30,000, a 20% down payment would be $6,000, leaving you with $24,000 to finance. If you opt for a four-year loan, you'll need to ensure the monthly payments and other car-related costs stay within your budget, representing no more than 10% of your monthly income.</p>
            <p>By following these steps, you can manage your car expenses effectively and avoid financial strain, ensuring you are not overspending on a depreciating asset.</p>
            <h3>Considerations and Potential Limitations</h3>
            <p>It's important to remember that the 20/4/10 rule is a guideline, not an absolute rule. It doesn't account for the economic changes over time, like wage stagnation and rising car prices. For instance, between 2010 and 2020, while the median household income increased by 37%, the average price of a new car jumped by nearly 61%.</p>
            <p>Also, personal preferences and financial priorities vary. Some people might choose to spend more on a car and less on housing, or vice versa. The rule is a starting point to help manage car expenses without financial strain.</p>
            <h3>Summary of the Rule</h3>
            <p>To apply the 20/4/10 rule:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure you can make a 20% down payment.</li>
                <li>Choose a loan term of four years or less.</li>
                <li>Keep your total monthly car expenses within 10% of your income.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By following these steps, you can avoid overspending on a car and minimize interest payments, ensuring your car remains an affordable part of your budget.</p>
